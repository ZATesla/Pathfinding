# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Project Overview
This project is a Python application that demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms on a grid-based GUI. Users can visualize how algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* find the shortest path between two points, and can add obstacles to create more complex scenarios.

## Features
- Interactive n x n grid GUI.
- Visualization of pathfinding algorithms in real-time.
- Ability to add and remove obstacles on the grid.
- Support for multiple pathfinding algorithms.
- Clear display of the starting point, ending point, obstacles, visited nodes, and the final path.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following pathfinding algorithms will be implemented:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* (A-Star) Algorithm

## Usage
(Instructions on how to run the program will be added here once the implementation is complete.)
